# Rawoochat-s-Expanded-Vanilla
Another modpack with Vanilla feel. Just with our view of things :D
## Description
Rawoochat's always cherished the simple and straightforward nature of Minecraft with absolute freedom for creativity and entertainment.
Alas, we do accept the fact this game is nowhere near perfect and there's a lot of things we'd like to have changed.
Luckly, Minecraft has one of the biggest and absolutely amazing modding community which can provide us with anything we could have asked for.

We tried to combine mods from lots of independent (and not so much) developers to enhance Minecraft while keeping the feel of it.

## Installation
1) Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rawoochat/Rawoochats-Expanded-Vanilla.git
   ```
2) Unpack the repository into your game's folder
   * On OS Windows:
     Generally in AppData
     ```bash
     %appdata%/.minecraft
     ```
     (Just enter this path into Explorer)

   * On Linux
     Depends on the launcher. Best rule of thumb would be to click a button to show game files.
3) Install mods
   This modpack was made in mind of modularity to give you a choice to install only the mods that you want.
   To achieve this we've split the mods into cathegories:
   * 0. Core -- Mods that would be beneficial to have on both client- and server-side and libraries;
   * 1. Client-side -- Mods that you may only need on client-side. Graphical and QoL mods;
   * 2. Server-side -- Mods that only have to be installed on server-side. Various worldgen and strucrtures mods and server-side fixes;
