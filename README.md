# Rawoochat's Expanded Vanilla
Another modpack with Vanilla feel. Just with our view of things :D
## Description
Rawoochat's always cherished the simple and straightforward nature of Minecraft with absolute freedom for creativity and entertainment.
Alas, we do accept the fact this game is nowhere near perfect and there's a lot of things we'd like to have changed.
Luckly, Minecraft has one of the biggest and absolutely amazing modding community which can provide us with anything we could have asked for.

We tried to combine mods from lots of independent (and not so much) developers to enhance Minecraft while keeping the feel of it.

## Installation
1) Clone or download the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rawoochat/Rawoochats-Expanded-Vanilla.git
   ```
   
3) Unpack the repository into your game's folder
   
   * On OS Windows:
     
     Generally in AppData
     
     ```bash
     %appdata%/.minecraft
     ```

   * On Linux:
     
     Depends on the launcher. Rule of thumb would be to click a button to show game files in your launcher of choice.
     
5) Install mods

   This modpack was made in mind of modularity to give you a choice to install only the mods that you want.
   To achieve this we've split the mods into cathegories:
   * Core - Libraries and mods would benefit client- and server-side;
   * Client-side - Graphical, QoL, sound, etc. mods that only need to be installed on client-side. Also take a look at subfolders;
   * Server-side - Worldgen, structure mods and fixes;
   * Serillum - A lot of QoL mods/datapacks by Serillum;
   * Server utilities - Permissions, maps and useful plugins;
     
6) Launch the game and have fun!
